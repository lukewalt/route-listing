In this exercise you will add a default view to your Routes of America application.

Add an additional route to your application that will load a listing view.
The listing view simply shows two hyperlinks that route the user to the two routes you built previously.
Add an otherwise configuration option to your routing.
Start http-server and access both of the existing routes and verify that they still work. Then verify that the base route works.

This route shows the list: http://localhost:8080/#/
